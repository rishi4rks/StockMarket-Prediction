## To run the UI you need Django setup installed in your machine.

### **Django** installation:

run in CMD: 
```
python -m pip install Django
```

After Django installation, open the project in any IDE(eg: VS Code) and

run in terminal: 
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Note: Right now UI shows option to analize trend only for `Google` stock price and `Nifty50` index values.

To provide more options, you need to update the code to accept trained model of any stock or index.
